Brooklyn Docker
===============

This project contains Brooklyn entities and examples for [Docker](http://www.docker.io).

### Getting started
This project requires a Docker instance that Brooklyn will use as a target location when deploying application blueprints. 

We suggest here two ways to deploy Docker: choose one of them!

#### Installing Docker using Brooklyn docker entity
You can use Brooklyn to install Docker onto an existing machine, or to install Docker onto a new cloud machine with your favourite cloud provider / cloud API.

To use the Brooklyn docker entity for installing docker on the host machine, there is an example blueprint at: [SingleDockerHostExample](https://github.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn-docker/blob/master/docker-examples/src/main/java/io/cloudsoft/docker/example/SingleDockerHostExample.java)

    % cd docker-examples
    % mvn clean install assembly:single

    % cd target
    % tar zxvf brooklyn-docker-examples-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.tar.gz
    % cd brooklyn-docker-examples-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
    % ./start.sh docker --location <favouriteCloud>

Where `<favouriteCloud>` can be e.g. `jclouds:softlayer`, or a named location or a fixed IP e.g. `byon:(hosts="1.2.3
.4")`.
Those simple steps will give you a running docker instance on your favourite cloud.

For more information on setting up locations, see the "Setting up Locations" section of [Brooklyn Getting Started](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/quickstart/index.html), 
and the "Off-the-shelf Locations section of [Brooklyn Common Usage](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/defining-applications/common-usage.html).

#### Installing Docker manually

Follow the [Getting Started](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/) guide and enable remote access to the docker API; on the host:
   `echo 'DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243"' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/docker`

###### Install the docker client (Optional step, for convenience of manually connecting to docker)
On OS X, see [official guide](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/mac/) or use homebrew:
    `brew install docker`
       
and point at your docker host:
    `export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://<host>:4243`

### Create a docker image that is ssh'able
Now that you have a Docker instance running, we need to create images that contain an ssh server so that brooklyn can reach them.

As before, we suggest a couple of options:

#### Using a Dockerfile:

Create a `Dockerfile` similar to this:

	FROM ubuntu:12.04

	RUN apt-get update
	RUN apt-get install -y openssh-server

	RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
	RUN /usr/sbin/sshd

	RUN echo 'root:password' | chpasswd

	EXPOSE 22
	CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]

and from the folder containing the `Dockerfile` run:

    docker build -t <yourName>/ubuntu .

See the [Dockerfile](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/reference/builder/) for more background.

#### Manually creating an image

The following instructions will help you in running a new container, installing and starting sshd on it, and committing that to create a new image. See [running_ssh_service](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples/running_ssh_service/) for more background.

    
	# First import a standard ubuntu image
	docker pull ubuntu

	# Start a new container
	docker run -i -t ubuntu:12.04 /bin/bash

	# From inside the container, set up sshd and the initial login credentials
	apt-get update
	apt-get install -y openssh-server
	mkdir /var/run/sshd
	/usr/sbin/sshd
	echo 'root:password' | chpasswd
	exit

	# Then from the host (or remote docker client)
	# grab the containerId of the customized container
	docker ps -a
	CONTAINER_ID=<containerId>

	IMAGE_NAME=<yourName>/ubuntu
	docker commit $CONTAINER_ID $IMAGE_NAME

#### Here are some simple docker commands to sanity check your setup:
- `docker images --no-trunc` to list all available images (showing full image ids)
- `docker run -i -t $IMAGE_NAME /bin/bash` to create a new docker container in interactive mode
- `docker ps -a` to list all containers; the `-a` says to include stopped images
- `docker ps -a -q | xargs docker stop | xargs docker rm` to stop and remove all containers
- `docker run -t -d -p 22 $IMAGE_NAME` to create a container, exposing port 22.
- `docker ps` to see port-mappings.
- `ssh -p <mapped-port> root@<hostAddress>` (with password "password", as supplied when creating the image) to confirm
  the new container is ssh'able (where <mapped-port> is the port mapped to 22 for that container, as shown by `docker ps`.

### Give it a go!

Now you have all the prerequisites satisfied so you can start playing with Brooklyn and Docker.

* Install [brooklyn](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/quickstart/index.html), or Cloudsoft's Application Management Platform (AMP) which is powered by Brooklyn.
* Create a section on your `~/.brooklyn/brooklyn.properties` as follows:

    ```bash
    # Defines a location named “docker” that can be used as a target when
    # deploying applications
    brooklyn.location.named.docker=jclouds:docker:http://<docker-host>:4243
    # Credentials currently ignored by docker API
    brooklyn.location.named.docker.identity=notused
    brooklyn.location.named.docker.credential=notused
    # Choosing a particular image
    # from the list returned by `docker images --no-trunc`
    brooklyn.location.named.docker.imageId=<IMAGE ID>
    
    # by default, the ssh credentials used are `root/password`
    # if your image has a different account uncomment the following:
    #brooklyn.location.named.docker.loginUser=<user>
    #brooklyn.location.named.docker.loginUser.password=<password>
    
* Add the docker entity to the brooklyn classpath:
  * Build `brooklyn-docker` repo locally (with `mvn clean install`)
  * Copy `docker/target/brooklyn-docker-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and `docker-examples/target/brooklyn-docker-examples-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to the `$BROOKLYN_HOME/lib/dropin/`
* Run `brooklyn launch --app io.cloudsoft.docker.example.SingleWebServerExample --location named:docker`
  where, "named:docker" matches the name you used in `brooklyn.properties` for `brooklyn.location.named.docker`.
* View the Brooklyn web-console to see the state of the app - the URL will be written to stdout by the `brooklyn launch`; by default it will be `http://localhost:8081`

To run a more interesting app that spans multiple Docker containers, try:
* `brooklyn launch --app io.cloudsoft.docker.example.WebClusterDatabaseExample --location named:docker`
